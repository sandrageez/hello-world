# hello-world

Learning to code and use GitHub. For reasons. 

Hello! I am Sandra. I am an adult child who likes to learn new things. I dabble in Python, but am learning Java in order to (hopefully) advance my career. I live in Houston, TX and am a former geoscientist turned IT person. I am 50% coffee.
